What are we doing:


  - Ports in front of plug  -- Done, but potentially there is hidden faff

  - Clearing out all that tween shit  -- I think done

  - realigning plugs and port holes.

  - creating the new routes div.

  - Make an about page

  - Center everything properly

  - Make it so the plug plugs in if the plug is touching anywhere on the port img.
