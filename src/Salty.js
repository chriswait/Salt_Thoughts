        <p>
        <p>
    Our thoughts are made of salt.
</p>
<p>
    Sweet, brill rad. We are now relatively confident in what goes on inside
    our heads. We have neurons that fill with salt to represent concepts.
    Within our head we have networks of those neurons that are specialised to
    different tasks and through the communication of all of those networks we
    get to the top level of our human neural network architecture: brains.
</p>
<p>
    But then you can actually go another level up and get brains which
    communicate with other brains.
</p>
<p>
    And by this I very simply mean people talking to each other.
</p>
<p>
    When you talk to someone else, you are involving them in your network
    architecture. And to clarify this, think about the â€˜scary tiger visualâ€™
    -&gt; â€˜feeling of run awayâ€™ we talked about in the last chapter. In that
    example we had multiple dedicated networks within your brain that were
    translating information into specific formats, so that other networks could
    read and translate the knowledge into further specific formats. Which, in
    that example, ended in the format of muscle signals needed to get your legs
    moving.
</p>
<p>
    And when you talk to someone, you do the exact same thing. You take an idea
    in the format of whatever peculiar neuron languages exist in your deep
    brain and your networks translate that into language, which is further
    translated into the muscle signals needed to move your mouth and tongue and
    vocal cords into the right shape to move the air coming outa your lungs in
    a specific way.
</p>
<p>
    The moving air, containing knowledge, is an embedding.
</p>
<p>
    And, exactly as we were saying when we were first talking about embeddings
    (how you can split a network in half, take the embedding you get as output
    from the first half and plug it back into the second half and it all stills
    works as one big network), to include someone else in your network you just
    need to put your embeddings into an input of their network that speaks the
    particular language your embeddings are in.
</p>
<p>
    And in this case the vibrating air goes into someoneâ€™s ear and moves their
    little ear bone around (or whatever the process is, I ent an ear expert) to
    produce a signal that is input to a particular network that can translate
    the knowledge contained in the â€˜how fast does the ear bone vibrateâ€™ signal
    back into language and then further networks translate it into the peculiar
    neuron languages of their deep brain, ready to start the whole process over
    again and reply back to you.
</p>
<p>
    If you made that system as a series of ANNs on a computer, youâ€™d just
    consider it all to be one big network.
</p>
<p>
    When you talk to someone, youâ€™re temporarily just one big network.
</p>
<p>
    When you watch a video of someone speaking on the internet, you, and
    everyone else who watched that video, are temporarily just one big network.
    ** Maybe say networks donâ€™t give a shit about time*
</p>
<p>
    Our whole society is just one big neural network, which just happens to
    have particularly egotistical neurons. And by neurons, in this context, I
    do mean whole people and not just the individual bags of salt.
</p>
<p>
    But right, as seen just there, we get ourselves into a little bit of a
    lexical mess at this stage and maybe need to sort out some of the
    nomenclature.
</p>
<p>
    Neurons â€“ Individual bags of salty water **mabs stop here** OR whole
    networks of bags of salty water OR whole people (which are themselves made
    of networks of networks of neurons). A neuron is just any node within any
    larger network that does a bit of processing to help the network as a
    whole. The classical biological neurons (the bags of salty water) can be
    referred to specifically as neuron cells, to differentiate them from the
    more general notion of Neuron. *** itâ€™s a messy definition ***
</p>
<p>
    Translation Nets ** - Networks of neurons dedicated to a specific
    translation task.
</p>
<p>
    People Nets - Larger networks composed of multiple Translation Nets that
    utilize the diversity of languages, and specific biases, of their component
    Translation Nets to perform a diverse range of tasks.
</p>
<p>
    God Nets â€“ Larger networks composed of multiple People Nets thatâ€¦ Well Iâ€™m
    not 100% sure honestly, but thatâ€™s what weâ€™re going to explore next ðŸ˜Š
</p>
<p>
    <br/>
    <br/>
    So, God Nets:
</p>
<p>
    Firstly whatâ€™s with the name? Why not go with the obvious choice of â€˜Social
    Networksâ€™?
</p>
<p>
    Well, firstly social network is a term which has definitely already been
    claimed by a related, but not identical concept (specifically the God Nets
    formed by the People Nets (footnote that I am just going to refer to People
    Nets as people from now on, because it feels silly to do anything else, but
    People Nets is what Iâ€™m referring to when I say people) using social media
    sites).
</p>
<p>
    But also, I have the suspicion (and it definitely is just a suspicion,
    because I canâ€™t really think of any way of saying for definite) that when
    people refer to, for example, the Christian God, what they are really
    referring to is the collective network formed by all the people who are
    involved in Christianity.
</p>
<p>
    All of the communion and socialisation and ritual involved in organised
    religion is sort of just a mechanism to keep people involved in each
    otherâ€™s networks and thus sustain the God Brain.
</p>
<p>
    *** People have always been able to see Gods, but never quite been sure
    what they actually were, and so described them with magic. But all the
    Greek and Roman pantheism, with different gods representing different
    aspects of the collective human psyche sums up it up really well. Ares is
    the God we are part of when we are conducting war, Dionysis is the God we
    are a part of when weâ€™re conducting getting fukked up, etc etc. Whereas a
    key part of the point of monotheism is cultural hegemony: The Christian God
    is the God we are a part of all our lives ***
</p>
<p>
    *** the bread and fish story really being a metaphor for how people come
    together and not actually be about miracles ***
</p>
<p>
    *** the weird stop start, non-temporal nature of God Brains
</p>
<p>
    <br/>
    *** something about an evolutionary basis for the thing â€“ hmm maybe, there
    is something here, but you canâ€™t quite see it â€“ antsss. â€“ and people and
    pwoer***
</p>
<p>
    ***** separately, at some stage we need to define language properly,
    stating that â€˜languageâ€™ is human language, and that any format of storing
    knowledge is a language, including images.**
</p>
<p>
    And in this case that is super duper easy, because the particular language
    is English (or whatever language you happen to be speaking in)
</p>
<p>
    the noise which represents the words . That knowledge is than transferred
    through the air
</p>
<p>
    The only tangible difference between There is a bottleneck in this shared
    network, in that any knowledge must be translated into a shared language at
    the interface of your two individual networks.
</p>
<p>
    # people like neurons are not preset and learn their weights and biases
    through living. Both are dynamic and can change their translation schema.
